Here are some things to remember when doing this.

1: This is not like other games, you can't just open a folder and clickity-click on some attributes and it's done. This is more complicated.

2: If something doesn't work, either 1, Look back through the whole thing and see if you can find what's wrong, 2, If option 1 doesn't work, don't be afraid to turn to the Smash Ultimate Gamebanana page or the Smash Ultimate Modding Discord. They are very friendly and will be happy to help you out, 3, If neither of those help you resolve your issue, submit an issue on this repository, E-Mail me at aquillaben@gmail.com, or DM me on Gamebanana @BenBro.

3: DON'T FORGET TO SAVE YOUR WORK! I've lost so much progress in not just this but other projects to because I didn't his CTRL-S. Don't be like I was, before or after anything important always save your work. You will thank me later.

Bonus: If you have trash internet like I do and it cuts out a lot, clone the repositories for WuBoy's Script Dump and LilyLavender's Blank mod template (Emphasis on the template, clone like 5 of these, you can save them for later and use them when you don't have internet.)

Bonus Bonus: If you try to build a mod without internet for the first time, it won't build, however, if you copy it over to a mod you have built, it will if you build it from there.

Bonus Bonus Bonus:  In your mod.rs file, when you pste in a script, unless your going to use them, delete the line like expression_attackairf, or effect_attackhi3. It'llkeep your mod organized, and make it less bloated when you export.
